-----------------PROBLEMS with MODULES --------------

Description: A simple readme that states the issues with various modules.


The overallScore() function in both IglooScore1 and IglooScore2 was unnecessarily complicated and poorly written. I made it less complicated and (hopefully) less poorly written.

The main function for the first class was perfectly fine.

The main function for the second class was unnecessarily complicated and had a very painful check for illegal input for the three integer arguments. I made a sub-optimal correction that drastically reduced the complexity for testing it, at the expense of speed. It goes without saying that when designing a normal application you wouldn't use this approach. But if one were say, designing a prototype and wanted to prove your application ran correctly in a quick fashion, that approach wouldn't be inappropriate.
